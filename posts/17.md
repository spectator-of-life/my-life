# The stability

**Date:** January 12, 2026

So things have been good from my last post and today I am writing this post to take a look back as what has been happening with us

So we've been having very good long online meetings learning postgres-sql until now, and solved many questions, since we had a week off and no classes, we thought (she suggested) we revise some of our old topics like springboot and postgres, I was more than happy and ready to do this, so we've had meeting multiple times spanning 2-3 hours each and man I just love listening her voice, also we solved many questions on sql and we did pretty good job solving them, I enjoyed

Now I had decided to have stability in my life and my working and talking and being with her, so the situations tested me both ways, by giving me much more and taking away too

So first day was good, then on second day when she herself messaged can we start I was in gah damn college because our mam called us for some project discussion, honestly I wanted to go home and just be with her, learning and listening, but alas I came home at 2 and started class as normal, she was instantly ready and we had class, I was very happy until this point but tried to keep my calm and stability with it

Now on next day I asked her let's start, and she said there was no light at her house, so I was sad and I messaged her in the afternoon if light came, she said no, so we chatted for some time, and she just asked do I eat nonveg, now this was very out of the blue but I love this thing, she's comfortable with asking me anything, but I like a idiot asked her why she asked(dumbasss), but it was ok, we talked for a while with a little flirtish(I think not that much, very little where I said to her I would love eat something that would be cooked by her someday) she said for sure while in office someday, so it ended there, still I was sad a little

Then next day I asked if shall we start then again she said she's going out somewhere and said will return by 1, I said ok message me when you're home, she said sure, but nothing happened that day, she didn't message me, I was just waiting and waiting , I was sad :( , but next day (today morning) I just randomely opened my mobile at 10:27 and opened her chat and she was online suddenly too, so she texted can we start :), I said yes, and then we had our meeting as normally as always, which was about ~2:45 hours, now it could've been longer but light jus suddenly was gone in their house so no wifi, no charging that much, so we had to wrap up :( , still I was ok as I can't do anything in that, also we got mail our little module is starting from tomorrow that too some people different lang and other diff, and she's in other group :( , so I am sad a little, as we I think we might not have that much communinication for a little time now and no online meets as this class's whole day long, so exhausting.

So the point was I try to be stable as much as possible, but I am not there yet, I really get excited when we have a good talk and I really was very upset yesterday, because she didn't message me. I should be patient and not assume her too much. 

Also today I was going through our old chats from may-jun 25 and to see any diff patterns of talking and honestly I can;t think of much difference like before she used to talk to me like she talks to me now too, only I think that we've been getting closer on my side, but I wonder 
- was she always closer to me?
- did she really liked me from start?
- as many times she has initiated convo's or asked questions and helped me too, I wonder if she really likes me inside ?(I hope) :) 
- or she sees me just as a friend ? (I hope not)(I would love to be friend and lover both though, that's good)

I think whether a relation will succeed really is in hands of the girl, will she reciprocate the feeling?, will she initiate?, how will be the relationship?, the vibe?, she really is just a sweet girl whom I like and will continue to do so and I hope she feeld same for me too :)

> **I HOPE THEIR COMES A DAY THIS YEAR WHERE WE BOTH CONFESS OR GET TO KNOW THAT WE LOVE EACH OTHER AND BECOME BF-GF AND WE SUPPORT EACH OTHER, BE THERE FOR EACH OTHER IN HIGH'S AND LOW'S, IN BAD AND GOOD DAYS, WE WOULD LOVE EACH OTHER UNTIL AND AFTER THE END OF OUR LIVES, AND WE MARRY EACH OTHER SOME DAY :)**

though coming days seem little rough to me, but I must be patient and continue to do so

> I love her soooo muuuuccchhh and will continue to do so and hope she lovess me too ♥ :)
