# A random thought

**Date:** January 20, 2026

So today I was watching April May 99 movie which is one the most favourite movies of mine
So in that movie I was thinking how lucky are those 3 guys as they got a female friend who is so innocent and pure hearted, who just wants to be friends with them, make them better, help them to get better, play with them. I was thinking I wish I had someone in my life like her.

But then I realised, I do have someone like her in my life currently, this girl I like :)

2 days ago when we were talking normally, she just randomly goes, like

> Can I say something?, you are so smart and you know so much, you should do better and perform good in internship. Like improve your voice and communication, and talk freely with everybody else how you talk with me so freely on google meet. If you perform good, you will have very good growth at company and in general

I also said
> I will keep that in mind, Your words means a lot to me, we'll definitely do that, we have a long way to go, and atlast I will always be there for you if you need me

and that conversation was so good, my hands were literally shaking from excitement, I never thought she would say something like that casually, which I absolutely loved by the way.

So I was thinking her being in my life sure have got some overthinking in me, but on brighter side, I've learned to be patient, to be kind, to be thoughtful, to listen, to not judge, to console, to take care, to check-in, to be friendly and most importantly to be courageous.

> I hope she's with me for my whole life ahead (as a good wife) and god I love her so much :) ♥
