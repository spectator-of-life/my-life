# The alleviation ♥

**Date:** December 11, 2025

So finally yesterday on Dec 10, 2025, I showed her my project that I made for her which is modification of existing cow language, which includes, `interpreter, compiler, automatic statement print generator, cow to new-lang converter (her name) and a tape visualizer`, so following is turn of events

> So I messaged in morning saying let's go get the hall ticket today, she said ok we'll go after 2, I reached the college at 2 and just after some time she came too, then we were in process of taking hall ticket, I had some application problems so I didn't get the hall ticket at that time, I had to get permission from higher ups, but she got it, so after that she asked are you waiting to get it, I said yes I have to wait, then she said I am going then I have to study, but I said then let me show what I had been waiting to show you 

> Then I started showing it to her, and delivered a long monologue of 10 minutes of everything I had made, and she said she liked it, and I was happy, she said she would read more about it and would explore on her own after some times, as our exams are going on currently, I said ok, then she said all the best to me and then I too said it and she happily just was gone from there, I also told her that how I was waiting for 3.5 months to show this to her, and she acknowledged it too

I had to wait there to get my hall ticket as I had to take some special permission to get it

**Now the thing is as soon she was gone I was stunned there thinking, this was very ordinary, I waited this long time of 3.5 months to show her my creation and I was anticipated it so much, our meetings were postponed so many times, and at last when I showed it to her, I felt very normal, no burst of tears or fireworks or sparkling air around me, it was as normal as it can be. And it ended on good note she said multiple times she liked and she showed interest although she was in hurry naturally, she at last waited, also she waited for while as I was in processing before I started presenting it to her, I exactly felt like how JOE from THE SOUL movie felt after his gig with dorothea's band, I was just reminded of that scene and very much reflect with dorothea's words, about old/young fish and ocean/water I was finally alleviated from my pain of so many days**

Also this incident happened exactly after one cycle, as we really first met while getting the hall ticket in out 6th semester, I feel all this is magical and same time very normal and sweet and slow, I wonder if she likes me or not yet, but I feel some relief

Also the other thing is that when I had gone to a religious/cultural gathering in evening after 7:30 and she messaged me regarding some doubt at 7:47 as I came home at ~10:54 I apologized and explained how I was gone out and couldn't reply, she had last seen at that time, but didn't see or acknowledge my message, I messaged her again after 12 hours in today morning if she's angry with me, she said now she isn't and she doesn't open whatsapp that much in exam times and said ok and I figured that some days and she said yes

So that's it for today

> I love her so much, I hope she loves me too ♥
