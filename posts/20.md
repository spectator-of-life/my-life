# The end of it

**Date:** February 17, 2026

So we started our internship from 2nd feb and I was anticipating meeting the girl I like and starting new phase of our life with her, where we would enter in corporate world and start working

Now on first day she wore this black shirt and cream colored pants and white heels and open hairs I guess, she was looking so much beautiful I couldn't take my eyes off her(and here I was looking like a dork a little), now we were waiting in the line but she was in back a little so I went ahead but I think should've stopped for her, but she came in after sometime with others, and sat in front row, but she kept a seat besides her empty I don't know why, but I took the chance and sat besides her, so we talked and talked with her on that day, had lunch with her and others, and roamed around with her, honestly it was good, she is just so beautiful I can't believe my eyes

Now from next day on my memory is little faded, but things kept going in a little far away, she would talk to me and atleast look at me, ask me questions/doubts, we were with others and 2 other girls joined too, and now everyday 6, sometimes 8/9 of us started to go have lunch together, now the thing is I was and I am a little afraid to talk with her sometimes, I may say something wrong or I don't have something to talk with her, I was having a breakdown in first 2 weeks sometimes on a mid scale, I cried once/twice too :(

Now the things are like currently where we almost don't talk anymore, she sits a little far from me, even if she's sitting besides me she won't ask me much questions, while having lunch she won't talk with me that much, or ask me question, she won't even look at me when I am looking or give a smile sometimes like she used too, I when sometimes try to ask her question she would give one liner answers and divert to something else.

She's so confident and charismatic, she has a very beautiful smile, I just keep looking at her sometimes, she talks so freely with everybody, she asks questions to others, teases them sometimes, laugh with them, but the thing is she never behaves like that with me, I don't know what to do, now the frequency is at all time low, almost zero, no convos, no initiation, no eye contact, no laugh shared, she talks so freely with others and never with me

Also there's this guy who's her friend, she talks many times with him, she knows everything about him, how he's doing, she gives his references many times while talking, I think I have no chance here and I'm sad about it :(.

The main point of writing this is that she's totally different that what I predicted would happen, we're just getting far and far, she doesn't care about me, and have no interest in me I guess, I've been feeling sad about it for long, and now after sometime, we'll be separated and she'll be with her team and I mine, and the distance will only widen, despite all this I wish she finds happiness in her life and I wish good for her future life, I don't what will happen, and I am sad, but maybe this would be start of something good and end of something good, I can never lose her if she never was mine to start with :(
