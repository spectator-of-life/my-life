# Happy and Sad

**Date:** September 11, 2025

## Context
So on 10th and 11th of september all of us from edgeverve had this traning session scheduled for soft skills/business communication and me and the girl I like - **S** (from now on I will take her name, (edit from post6 :rather no)) decided we will meet to learn about wsl/linux
> For some context I have been planning to meet her for long time, from like past 2-3 weeks where I schedule or say hey let's meet and she says yes, but afterwards due to some particular reason everytime our meeting doesn't happen, and it has happened for like 3 times before

## Happy Part
So on 10th sept I got normally ready with my college shirt and a black pant I always wear and nothing else special, I didn't give that much effort to look good and I headed for the session
But to my surprise as I enter through the door my eyes were searching for her and I saw her sitting in the first row with her other friends and then **I LOOK AT HER, SHE LOOKS AT ME AND THE SEAT NEXT TO HER WAS EMPTYYY AND SHE HINTS TOWARDS ME TO COME AND SIT IN THIS SEAT** I was like *DAMMMMNNNNNN* and I have a seat besides her, I had made my mind already, something like this would never happen but there it happened 

I was sitting besides the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, the girl I like, it was first time ever we had so much talk, so much fun over whole day, the session was from 9:30 to 4:30 honestly it was one of the greatest day of my life until now.
We had laugh, we cracked jokes, we discussed things, we asked questions, I encouraged her to answer questions, it was very good in my opinion
I had never imagined this would ever happen

After the session ended we got out and then while on stairs I asked would you stop for some time after the session tomorrow, as we had said we would meet, and she said ok and I was happier
> The reason I was always anticipating and still anticipate meeting her was that I wanted to show her the set of programs I made for her like a whole ass language with her name and some tools around it to impress her

I got to the ganpati/vitthal mandir near my house that evening and thanked god for the day he has given me, and asked some strength and courage for the tomorrow evening for what I was going to show her(that project) when we meet.

## Sad part
So on 11th sept morning I was nervous but happy that today I might get to sit besides her once again and we'll have fun in the session like yesterday, so I shaved my little excessive beard that I had got, my father trimmed the extra hair from back of head, my father got me college pant ironed, as I was doing it myself, I had wore my tie that day, as I said to her yesterday that I will wear one tomorrow

And there I go taking blessings from god and my parents to have upcoming day a little better or as good as yesterday, but as I arrive in the college what I saw was totally different, **SOME GUY FROM OUR BATCH WAS ALREADY SITTING BESIDES HER**, SO MY DREAMS WERE SHATTERED AS I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT THIS EARLIER THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS WILL HAPPEND FOR SURE LOOKING AT MY LUCK'S PAST HISTORY, I digested the reality and sat in front row of where she was sitting, still until this time I had thought in my mind that atleast we will be meeting after the session today, so as sessions continued we had a break we got out for refreshments and we had a little common chat but nothing more

So after some time there came a long break and everybody got out for lunch, I had some other work to do and she was out too I guess. But when we came back I was waiting for her to come and she didn't come, the session started and she still hasn't arrived and my fear came true, that *somehow today also we will not be able to meet looking at the past history of near missed for meeting*, after sometime I came to know that she had suddenly been ill and decided not to come again after break, and there once again my ambitions were shattered successfully I had been waiting for so long, I still don't know for how long I have to wait to meet her and show her my creation for her, today was not so good day

Well after some time after session ended I called her and asked her about what happened and all, while I talking I said that *our meeting always gets postponed* as she was asking when's the next time I am coming to college and I said tomorrow, I felt wrong that how I talked to her today, it felt confrontational which I always avoid, that too to a ill person, that wasn't very gentleman of me, she also sent me a text later saying how she doesn't postpone our meeting but it just somehow get's we can't get common dates

well I feel this is god's will or whatever and I can't expect a good moment ever to happen with me

## Learning
When I expected nothing from god he gave me one of my best days I had, and when I asked him for something with some expectation suddenly it was not valid, not even the least I expected atleast, the certain part I thought was possible. Remaining with little to no expectations is the only way I think of, or to be ready for the worst that can happen

BUT STILL SHE IS THE GIRL I LIKE AND WILL BE
