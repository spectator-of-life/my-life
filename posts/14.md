# The distance

**Date:** December 17, 2025

So from my last post where I showed the girl I like the the project I made for her and she liked it, things have been very dull since then

That day in the evening she messaged me for some doubt clearance related to DAA but I had gone somewhere else and I missed her message then I came home at 11pm and I saw her message and said sorry to her and said that I had gone somewhere therefore I didn't message. I asked next day if she's angry and she said no, she just don't see any messages during exam I said ok.

Then after I once messaged about the repository access invitation that I sent her for my project, which she hasn't accepted yet, she acknowledged it after long time like multiple hours, that too short messages, also when I meet her near exam time and asked her how was paper she said ok and smiled that's fine, once I had gone to her and said all the best and she too said, 

The thing is she won't talk to me or even look in my direction unless I approach her, which I think she just does with everybody
Day before yesterday I called her at 9 to ask something, but she didn't pick up call, I can see her last seen, but she won't ask me why I called, she won't talk to me like before she did. She had this way of conversing, but I can't see anything like that from ~1 week, she's disinterested to talk, she won't ask if my test was good, when I asked if her's was good, also the gap in replies, I am afraid where these things are going

> Either she has no interest in me, especially after I showed her my creation, and I am loss here, also I missed her message on that day which isn't intentional btw

> Or this is just a testby god, she will return to normal after exams end and our classes will start or she will even be better than before, I don't what's going to happen.

I hope it's just that this is exam time and she's just not disinterested in me

I've written this today to lessen my grief :(

> Still, all I have is love for her in my heart ♥
