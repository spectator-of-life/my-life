# The ray of hope

## Preface

So some time ago from month of july end to august mid, things were very difficult. I was going through this phase of detachment and yearning, where I constantly thinked about S, the girl I like. But the thing was, from past sometime her messages were really dry and she seemed not interested to talk or to atleast have an conversation, like replying after much gap in messages and not reciprocating questons etc.

So I just stopped this type of messaging from my side as I can't force her to have a conversation or me initiating everytime to talk about something. I would go for a walk daily and like just feel sad in that timeframe, we weren't talking, idk that must've not been anything different for her, but I was sad

## Minor part
So continuing this, one day after a walk in evening I was sitting in our society temple's bench with some cloudy environment, little windy and cold which was perfect, I was listening to My way by Frank Sinatra(one of my favourite songs) and then I decided to message her about some assignment we had in class, with little to no hope that I would get any message in less than 2 hours, but as the song continues I see she messaged right away, I was shocked, then as asked 2-3 questions and said ok good at last where I expected that the small talk ended,suddenly out of nowhere she sends a standard smiley emoji :smile: (DAMNNN) and here I am like whatttt, why did she messaged me smiley? But I felt good that day as my way is playing in background like some main character music. Then I too replied with a :smile: not knowing what to do.

## Major part
Now after sometime of this, while we were in class, some topic was going on, which everybody found very difficult to do and understand and so does she, but she didn't ask me for help this time. As I've helped her multiple times in past, but just I thought if she needed help, I just messaged **Hey have you done that** referring to topic in class, after sometime she messaged no, she wasn't able to so I said let's solve the errors you are encountering and we started doing it, as she shared some screenshots/images of error messages, I started suggesting some solutions

But since it would be exhausting she just messages me **Can I share you my screen ?**, I was like bro this has to be miracle, she is asking to have a quick online meet dammmnnnn, then I lightningly said sure, then the meeting started and we started talking, well for some context *once some 2 months ago I asked her thatcan we have a google meet if she hasn't understood something in class, she said yes first once but then no later, I understood and just said that's ok and not a big deal*

But now things were different, I am here talking to the girl I like and honestly I enjoyed every second of that meeting btw which was fricking **50 mins** long, man I just love her voice, it's little different and she sounds like she has some mild fear or something when she talks, idk why but still I totally enjoyed that night, and was happy for what god gave me that day. This all happened on **Tuesday 2025-08-12**, she even asked me about some tests, college projects and we also laughed due to some other ongoing not-so-tests tests and overall the env was nice and not tense.

## Major part 2
Now right after that on wednesday same things happened, now this time she asked upfront for some error while in class and she said once again I will share my screen after class, I was like **DAMMMMNNNN** again, I said ok, again on same night we had meeting for like **40 mins** now the other thing was while asking about errors in today's topics she also asked me about wsl use, which she knew I am really fond of and help many people regarding it, I was like good that she is taking interest in learning new things from me and doesn't refrain from asking something more.

After that I yapped for like 10-15 mins about all basic things she should know about linux/wsl2 and she listened and asked questions to me and loved it too. Again this was very soothing for me and I loved every bit of it.

## Learnings
I feel I was very desperate for her attention in before mentioned period of despair, which was wrong, the moment I decided to not chase, but just show genuine interest or hand for help she herself asked for it, I think things you want come at very unexpected timing, god won't give me just the thing that I wanted but will make me live without it to test me, but will provide it the moment I learn to not chase but be patient and real, with acceptance and faith.
