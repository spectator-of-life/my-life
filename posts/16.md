# Self Reflection

**Date:** January 1, 2026

So after the last post where the girl I like and me met during a college event, and things were silent dur to exam, we've started talking normally again, as our classes have started and since 25 Dec things we're normal again `btw last year on 26 dec we got to know that we've been selected for edgeverve and it was turning point for me` so like she asks  questions and I answer, we even had 1h15min meeting to teach her about unix/linux & cmd, though she responds late sometimes which is normal I guess.

Now the reason I am writing this post is because I can't seem to know what I am going to do going ahead, here's a reddit post I read today

> So a girl posted about how there's a guy from her college who was her good friend and they were in same college club, and had good relations as friend, then this guy proposes to her to near there graduation time, that too in a bus while coming from somewhere with their group, she said no but still this guy asks her questions, trys to chat with her, asks to hangout or can we go to this movie, she clearly has no intention of having relationship with this guy, but he thinks maybe if he will try more, he has a chance, that is he can't seem to accept the no, even she replies very dryly after like 2 days for how r u.

Now above incident made me hella scared as I was thinking, this shit is too relatable, I like this girl and she is ok and alright but I am scared will this happen to me? If ever I say to this girl that I like her, will she just ghost me, as I think she has no interest in me romantically(obvious) but I think I have a chance

And the other thing is I think I have a competitor, there's this guy from her class and they're good friends, they know each other from long and work together on their project(final year group) then they have good pics together, they are many times together, then today this guy posted a story about his last year recap spedup images and the girl I like was there too, like 4 to 5 times, twice in a group photo, then twice with small group(3-4) then one with just both of them only, and the thing is this guy's tall, good shape, looks good, is intelligent enough, and just a normal guy, I can't hate him because he's friend's with her (ok I don't like him for that) but other than that he's just normal guy and they're just friends and still sometimes have 0.01% doubt they might like each other, I am not sure though and I hope they are not into each other

Now the reason for writing this today is I don't know what's going to happen here onwards, I for sure like her and would like to take care of her forever, bt...
- what if I tell her someday that I like her, and she just ghosts's me?
- what if my desire to gain a lover makes me lose the current friend I have?
- what if I am not able to tell her that I love her and someone else tells her before me, and she accepts it?
- what if she likes somebody else?

But even after this, I'll just continue on my path and try to be as authentic, caring, helping, I am for her, and be kind to myself
Also this is written to future me (bro if even it ever happens that she just leaves us, we too have to let her go and not chase thinking just might that we have a chance, though I hope this never happens for us, and your past self loves you bro)

This may seem like I make posts just when things are going bad, but I should also say that I am ok with current and hope to make progress ahead and I just like her :) 

> Still all I have is love for her in my heart ♥
