# Sad

So after our 2 days of very good meeting and studying, I got my hopes up high and thought I had a chance, but after she just started evading or pulling away, suddenly I was seeing uninterested responses, no enthusiasm, so enquiry if test was good, late replies like early on we used to have, and pulling away from online meeting for ML, that I insisted.

I said ok and that's it, I have 2 scenarios here
1. She's just not interested and pulling away or she's got an idea of my intention(only good intention I have)
2. This is exam period and she doesn't participate in any type of normal talk or meeting, she's extremely focussed and won't even unfocus for a minute, which is I think appropriate and I should follow it too, she's right on her side

Perhaps I wrote this to lessen my grief :(

> still I love her ♥
