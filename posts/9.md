# Not so sure feeling

**Date:** December 01, 2025

So the last real update was on Sep 22 2025 I guess and after that I really just forgot about this and writing today again

So up until now my relation with the girl I like is pretty ok, like we really talk with each other.
- when she has some doubt or need anything she really just asks me without thinking that I might judge which I really don't that much
- multiple times when their is some convo going in main group and we all are discussing something, she would just personally message and ask me something and give her opinions to me, she really just doesn't talk that much in group, rather she converses with me
- she really sometimes do care about me, one time I had to give a test and I was travelling in bus, so I she asked how would do this and that and all the best and then after would ask to how was my test, next recently I we had capstone project which is a major test and we had some bad timing as I was to attend an function of my cousins marriage ritual and I also had birthday, so we're here conversing in group and she is side by side talking with me asking how would you do, and some rant in really cutesy tone or way, like she was annoyed for me that I will be having difficuly giving test
- Most of the times she would just ask upfront about class timings and if their there today or not, I wonder why she has started asking me if there is class today frequently not that I hate it, but I think she is getting comfortable with just having even a silly doubt and asking me, as she know I would definitely answer for quetions
- once in a while she would also ask about how was my test and all out of blue, she would message in class about if she has any doubt 
- recently the way we talk has been getting better, I guess we've started to get comfortable with asking things to each other and also I get replies back fairly quicky, unlike initial days when sometimes it would definitely take 6-7 hours for a reply, and she asks for soemthing then I ask for something

> Sometimes I wonder, does she have any idea that I might be liking her and want to take this ahead and really I do care about her

- but one thing that still haunts me is that I never get to meet her offline intentionally, like we've met on practical/exam days or some work in college days, but whenever I've asked to meet even if for technical purpose it's like I get brutally/gracefully ignored, that really hurts in my heart

**So in recent time we had project presentation day and 2 days before I messaged and said let's meet for after that to discuss something about her laptop's wsl/linux setup which is remaining from ages (3 months now) she said yes let's meet, one the day as our presentation are to be done, we meet and talk a little as usual and go in our ways, I also meet her while in between and she asks are your going now (as our's was done and their's remaining), I said no I am waiting and also said to notify or call me when you're done she said ok, then I waited for like and hour or so, as I see her walk by the class I was sitting in and just go outside of college, and here I was waiting for her, I messaged her twice once even tried to call and she just ignored and was like damn that's embarrasing, after I asked she said she got anxious and didn't stop in college and all.**

**My point was that she really just doesn't care that someone has asked her to meet after getting things done, she wouldn't even just message me that she is not coming, she just doesn't care and I am idiot here, which I think really am to expect her to stop by as she needs me, I am the one who asks and she says yes but doesn't show up, at this point I am just hurting myself**

**Even today I hoped we'll meet for hall ticket collection but she said she'll be coming tomorrow as her term grant got lost when I asked but she found it really when I asked in the evening near to lecture, I get a feeling that she might just be dodging or even I am that even significant to dodge, it's just these things make me pretty unsure**

- Now after these type of incident's I really have 2 different pictures about her in my mind
> She is just a shy and innocent girl where nothing's intentional and things just happend unintentionally, she doesn't mean to hurt and she cares about me
> Another is like yeahh she's dodging me and I just make fool of myselves everytime and she isn't interested in me.

**I am really waiting for the day I will get oppurtinity to present my beautiful creation to her that I've been desperate to sow her from so many days now, and It's becoming difficult to handle
But I think I'll just forget about it and wait for right moment maybe in future, I think it must not be right time yet so I am just waiting really**

- I feel like I should just sometimes shutup and do my work, I really coud've been so much different now.
- Though no hate to her as these incident's continue to shape my experinces and make me wiser even if I get defeated, I should be cautious to not get deadlocked into some situation and lose my mental peace 

> EVEN AFTER THIS, ALL I HAVE IS LOVE FOR HER IN MY HEART
