# Who am I

**Date:** August 2, 2025

- So I am just an average 21 year old guy from this world
- I am a type of person who's trying to live his life to fullest but often times runs into life's complexities and it's hardships

## Who am I without my real identity physically
- Often times when we ask people who they are, often they say
	- their name
	- the place they belong to
	- who their parents are
	- the profession they work in
	- their societal status etc.
- Well we can't escape from the materialistic identity of our's as we live in the materialistic world
- But once I heard you need to think of your trueself when you try to think of your identity besides things I mentioned above
- I believe our identity can include the skills and knowledge we've acquired while on this world
  
## The standard answer I think
> I am the universe observing itself, I am the eye, ear, hand, foot of the universe. Universe starts from me and never ends. My mind is boundless as the universe itself is. 

## The real answer
- Honestly I don't know who I am
- What's my purpose in this big of a universe which gives us so little time, and so little speed to explore it?
- Are we never meant to understand the universe in it's entirety?
- But I try everyday to find my real identity and purpose

## Until then bye
