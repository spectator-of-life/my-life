# Ray of hope 2

**Date:** December 02, 2025

So yesterday I wrote about how I was feeling kinda not so sure about what's happening, but today something unusual happened

## Start of the day
So today was my class scheduled from 10 to 12 which I forgot then I got a message at 10:40am from her that join class and she to has just joined the class the class as she too might've forgot joining class, then I hurriedly joined and thanked her, I felt really good after that, as I know she do care about me as I care about her

## Main part
Then now after class I had some work to do, so I got out to do that work but it wasn't done so I just was little annoyed and got back home, but I was in the parking area and just going up, I got a message from her asking have I started preparation for endsem I said no, I haven't then we texted for some time and then suddenly while texting she stopped for 2 mins and I thought, she must've lost interest or some so I too stopped but as I was getting up to go, **I GOT A CALL FROM HER, AND I WAS LIKE DAMMMMNNNN** so I picked up the call and started talking and then we spoke about endsems and classes and her friends, our batch and it's people and how they are etc. and mind you talked for about ***friggin 42 MINS*** that was so long and so good, I genuinely enjoyed talking with her for first time we talked really freely and not about only study but also some other things and I was also able to hold conversation and she too was having a 2 way conversation so I think that was pretty good

And the good part is all this happened while I was sitting alone in open ground floor's chairs and I wasn't at home so I was concerned about mom listening and also since I was out I didn't have to give explanation, all of this was like very awesome and was like stars aligned to make this happend

We also texted about the function that I attended yesterday and she was responsive and didn't dismiss my enthusiasm to tell her something, that was cool too

## Conclusion 
Today's day was really good and liked how we're getting closer as days advanced, I do still have some doubt about her liking me or she might be liking some other guy, but we'll know about it in future definitely but this hunch won't dismiss today's great day I had :)

> I'll say it again, all I still have is only love for her in my heart ♥
