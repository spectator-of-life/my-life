# The end of it

**Date:** January 27, 2026

So as from my last post where I mentioned that how I like this girl so much and her encouraging words and all, I think that was the peak of it, before the cliff ends straight down, so there was just messaging like normal where I asked question, she answered, it was ok, but then one night while we were chatting , she said hmm at end I replied with hmmm, then I replied with cow emojis and she responded with a laugh emoji, then it ended awkwardly after that, then next day we didn't talk much I asked if she had any plans, she said she's busy and will be travelling over the weekend, then we didn't talk for almost 3 days now and her replies are getting short and with long pauses in between, I think it's just might be over, I fumbled it at last and she might think I am a pathetic dork, well we'll be starting over internship from monday I don't know what will happen, I am afraid a little, I hope everything's okay :(

I hope that our time at internship goes very smooth without any awkwardness and bad timings or moments, I hope progress ahead very good in my employment at this company and she too :)

> Still I love her ♥ :)
