# Progression

**Date:** December 07, 2025

So from last 2-3 days, things have been going crazy
She reminded to join classes everytime I missed them and I think she genuinely cares about me, which happened about like 3 times
> Also 4th Dec is her birthday which is very close to mine and that's very fascinating
So on 5th dec friday, after class we were talking about how we're not able to do endsem prep and she too was not able to do it, and then she asks me like can we do some preparation for DAA subject on meet, I was OKKK let's do it, and she was like NOWW and I was like DAMMMMNNNN OK, then we actually started meet and then studied for like ***friggin ~2:45/3 hours*** on meet related to DAA subject, I was very happy

Then again we did same in the night from 10:30 to 12:00 so like 1.5 hrs
Then again next day (yesterday) for like 2:15 hours from 11:45 to 2:00, and will might continue this for ML subject or other too

# Conclusion
My experience from this is, that she's not like hard to talk or scary, she's just as normal human like me or everybody, I shouldn't put her on pedestal and idealize her, from this study that I did with her, I think I've lost my fear of talking with her, I now have some good sample of her voice, also I love to listen to her speak, I just like it :). I will continue to have this and I hope I can show her my creation soon enough

> I'll say it once again, all I have is love for her in my heart ♥
