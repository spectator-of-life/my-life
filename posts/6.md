# Mixed feelings about her

**Date:** September 22, 2025

So after the last incident happened where I think she really was not feeling well that day, so our meeting was abruptly cancelled, I have lost hope for whether how will things go.
This is either fate playing  with us or rather me, or she really isn't just interested. 
I also said sorry to her as I thought I said something to her and she replied with a message explaining herself
Things look rather ok or simple to me
She asks doubt while in class if any
She messages me whenever she has a problem

So day before yesterday our evening class was cancelled so I thought I would just message her, if she has seen the mail
She said yes, after we chatted a little about class and how I was selected as colead for gdg appdev team, she congratulated me and, she said she is getting bored and want's to participate in something like this, but she isn't confident, after which I asked her that can I call her? she said yes and we talked for fricking **12 mins**, and that was honestly good, I consoled her, she thinks she doesn't have any confidence but I can see that she is improving and getting better and better, so I reassured her and our little chat ended.

## My current feelings
Well I think I am in mix signal area, where sure she would message me if has a problem but won't for other than that, or to check upon too, I thought about to meet her and show her my creation for her which was btw created with first working version on august 22 2025, whole one month before from now, but I still haven't gotten any chance to meet her, it has been postponed like 4 times I guess, well even if that's not a problem, the thing is she won't try to reschedule or ask from front are you free today, or this week, so I should probably get that she isn't interested in me *sad emoji*. I don't know where this is going and I am thinking I am sort of getting away from her, I literally don't know what's happening.
