# The courage

**Date:** December 24, 2025

So on Saturday 19 Dec 2025, we had a event in auditorium for all the placed students in college, so I got ready for the event and gone to it

Now to the main part
some selected students started giving speeches about their placement journey and where they were selected, after 2 speeches announcer asked is their anybody else who would like to tell their story

> And now I've been waiting for something like this and had some things in my mind, but I thought that would be rare, but here the announcer asked if anybody was going to speak, I looked 4 seconds and then raised my hand, I was shocked and afraid a little, still I gone on the stage infront of 1000 people and gave my speech, I spoke from my heart, my heart was racing and said that too, it was good and little motivation type, I spoke about everybody and where we would be after so much time, we would be working somewhere else, what's better as a human being fearless or overcoming fears etc. I also saw her(the girl I like) from up there, she was looking at one of the screens I think, It was good, everybody applauded and I felt good too

Especially as the event ended many people I even don't know started appreciating me for my speech, they said nice speech genuinely and felt good, even many people I know appreciated me and I felt good

Also on that day I was with everybody so also her and enjoyed the time, we spoke normally and about some other topics, it was pleasant at last she said bye to me and gone to her friends, now after that I was with my friends and she with hers, I just turned my head a took glance at her from distance, she was also looking at me I think, she smiled and again waved good bye, and I too smiled and waved goodbye!!! I felt very good

> Honestly that day was very good and I hope she likes me more than I like her ♥
