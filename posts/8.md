# An unusual/diff experience

**Date:** December 01, 2025

So yesterday on Nov 30 2025, I had gone to my cousins wedding reception and a *[JAAGRAN](https://mr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A3_%E0%A4%97%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%B3)* that was scheduled that night

At first I was very skeptical to go and thought, man I have to sit there for so long doing nothing and I'd be bored but god had other plans that day, so I was just sitting there casually and suddenly there came this girl (let's call her S), she was my cousin sister's friend and mind you she was a pretty girl, she had a bubbly personality that I sensed and I was hesitant to talk to her first

So I was just sitting on the sofa on one end and my mother and her on other end just doing their own things and here I was thinking of striking a conversation with her somehow, I did that eventually by talking about this malfunctioned speaker which was blasting loud songs outside, so as I started I asked her what do you do and what school do you attend and blah blah, good thing was that she was easy to talk to, means it's like she wasn't disinterested and in turn would ask question, so the conversation was not only one sided, so felt good actually that I was actually able to hold conversation with a girl I just met

She was a 2nd Year BCOM student (commerce) and asked about what she does and all whatnot, and I told her about my field and working too, it was pretty good actually, while we were talking someone would come for some work or I had to do something in between and would have to stop. So after some time at last when there was no work for me and the seat besides the place she was sitting on sofa was empty for 5-8 minutes and no was sitting, I just got up and sat there normally, then again I started conversing with her about her different interests and what she likes and all, she said she always liked doing maths so she chose accounting/commerce etc. as she was good at doing that.

But after conversing more she said always wanted to be an actress, and she recently has started posting content on social media and she has a instagram account, which she started posting on only from past 2-3 months as her parents and uncle wasn't allowing her to post on social media previously, and I could really see that she really wants to be a famous person and to be honest her personality seemed she would become that type of person, she was wearing this what colored dress and a very elegant shawl type sweater of brown colour on top that actually looked pretty cool and elegant.

After that I had to sit for my work there in the house, then she was gone pretty much at last, I wanted to say all the best to her but couldn't do so, also I helped her locate her hair claw for which she said really thank you to me :)

After all this we had jagran gondhal started and it was pretty cool and I actually enjoyed the whole thing

## Conclusion
So this was a very different experience, I saw some girl at some family functions, I got this urge to try and talk to her and hold some solid conversation and in turn I also actually got questions asked, not just one sided convo, although it was nothing special it's just her personality to talk friendly with everybody that asks and that's good. I never expected some kind of need to feel attracted or make an impression but rather just a urge overcome my fear of talking with new people and getting to know them for better. I am pretty much still hesitant to talk with any girl, but I'll get there eventually
